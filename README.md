# Closed Forever, This Hub Will Not Gonna receive any update from 7/15/2023





That hub is in Pre-Early development.

(Most of scripts are not mine)

-How to use Koala Hub?
-First you need an executor, I recommend to use paid executors, because in free ones you will need a key every 24h/48h. 

-Which free executor is the best? 
-Krnl (Runs ~90% of scripts, but updates too long and got 24h key system). 

-Which paid executor is the best?
-Synapse (I recommend it, runs all scripts, keyless, costs 15-20$ (15$ only with crypto)), Sentinel (Runs ~95% of scripts, keyless, cost 15$). (I don't recommend because: others other exploits are not popular | updating too long | just closed)

-Can I use my own executor?
-Yes
